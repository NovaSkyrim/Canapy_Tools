Canapy Tools Documentation

Welcome to Canapy Tools! This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to facilitate audio model training and annotation. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you utilize each script effectively.
Getting Started with Canapy
Main Scripts

    Canapy_Main_Pipeline.py: Use this script to easily train a model and annotate unannotated audio files.
    Canapy_Training.py: This script is specifically for training a model with Canapy.
    Canapy_Annotation.py: Use this script to annotate unannotated audio files using a pre-trained model.

Reproducing Experiments
Basic Experiments

"Basic" refers to training the model on all available data for optimal performance across multiple seeds to evaluate its reliability:

    BASIC_Training_Annotation.py: This script trains models and annotates a dataset across several seeds within a working directory.
    BASIC_Metrics.py: Utilize this script to calculate metrics from the annotations generated by BASIC_Training_Annotation.py, including the syllable error rate and frame error rate.

Data Size Experiments

"Datasize" involves progressively increasing the training set to observe Canapyâ€™s performance with growing amounts of data:

    DATASIZE_Training_Annotation.py: Train models on various train/test splits within a working directory.
    DATASIZE_Metrics.py: Calculate metrics generated by DATASIZE_Training_Annotation.py, such as the syllable error rate and frame error rate.
    DATASIZE_Graph.py: This script plots and saves a graph representing the performance evolution of Canapy based on training set size.

Additional Scripts

    CheckWavSamplingRate.py: Retrieves the sampling rate of a .wav file, which is essential for training with Canapy.
    Check_Dataset_Syllables.py: Extracts and displays all labels represented in an annotation folder.
    EditDistanceCalculator_Marron1.py: Calculates the edit distance between two annotation folders in the Marron1 CSV format.
    EditDistanceCalculator_Vak.py: Computes the edit distance between two annotation folders in the SimpleSeq format.
    FrameErrorRate.py: Calculates the frame error rate between two annotation files in the Marron1 CSV format.
    Marron1ToDAS.py: Converts an annotation folder to a format accepted by DAS.
    Marron1ToSimpleSeq.py: Converts an annotation folder from the SimpleSeq format to the Marron1 format (this conversion is handled automatically by Canapy).
    Model_reader.py: Reads the configuration of a model trained by Canapy.
    SimpleSeqToMarron1.py: Converts an annotation folder from the SimpleSeq format to the Marron1 CSV format.
    UMAP_Marron1.py: Displays a UMAP visualization of a dataset in Marron1 CSV format.
    WavCopy.py: Copies .wav files from one directory to another.
    Wav_Analyze.py: Analyzes the temporal data of .wav audio files in a dataset, aiding in the decision of sequence values for a Datasize.
